# SOC Estimation Using Temporal CNN

![SOC Estimation](https://img.shields.io/badge/SOC%20Estimation-Deep%20Learning-brightgreen)

This repository contains an implementation of a Temporal CNN model for State of Charge (SOC) estimation in lithium-ion batteries. Previously, we explored LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for SOC prediction tasks, given their effectiveness in handling sequential data. However, while LSTM performed well in many cases, we observed fluctuations in SOC predictions, particularly during rapid changes in SOC. These fluctuations motivated us to explore alternative architectures better suited for capturing temporal dependencies without introducing the level of complexity associated with LSTM models.

### Why Temporal CNN?
Temporal CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks for time-series data) offer an efficient alternative to recurrent models like LSTM. Temporal CNNs can capture local temporal patterns in the data, and they are often faster and less prone to overfitting when dealing with large sequences. Unlike ConvLSTM, which combines convolution and recurrence, Temporal CNN focuses purely on convolutional layers to extract temporal features, making it both simpler and potentially more robust for our task. Through this approach, the Temporal CNN achieved precise SOC predictions with minimal fluctuations and a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **1.41%**, marking an improvement over prior methods.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

### ü§ñ Why Temporal CNN?

The Temporal CNN is chosen for its efficiency in handling sequential data without the complexity of recurrent connections. By stacking convolutional layers, the model captures temporal dependencies and local patterns, making it particularly effective for SOC data with fluctuating trends across different temperatures.

### üîç SOC Prediction Error Analysis

The following section provides an analysis of the SOC prediction errors for different ambient temperatures (-10¬∞C, 0¬∞C, 10¬∞C, and 25¬∞C), as visualized in the error plots.

#### üìä Key Insights:
1. **Overall Error Distribution**:
   - Across all temperatures, the model maintains a low prediction error for most of the SOC range, highlighting its robustness and accuracy in tracking SOC trends.
   - Prediction errors generally stay within a 0.05 (5%) range, with occasional spikes. This consistent performance demonstrates the model's reliability under various temperature conditions.

2. **üå°Ô∏è Temperature-Specific Observations**:
   - **0¬∞C**:
     - Error remains consistently low across most of the samples, with periodic spikes around significant SOC transitions.
     - This suggests that the model performs well at 0¬∞C, with minor deviations during rapid SOC changes.
     - ![Prediction Error at 0¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_0C_plot.png)

   - **10¬∞C**:
     - The error pattern is similar to that at 0¬∞C, with slightly increased variability.
     - Some notable error spikes appear around the middle of the SOC range, potentially due to transitional states where SOC estimation becomes more challenging.
     - ![Prediction Error at 10¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_10C_plot.png)

   - **-10¬∞C**:
     - At lower temperatures, the model encounters more variability in error, with more frequent and noticeable spikes.

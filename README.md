# SOC Estimation Using Temporal CNN

![SOC Estimation](https://img.shields.io/badge/SOC%20Estimation-Deep%20Learning-brightgreen)

This repository contains an implementation of a Temporal CNN model for State of Charge (SOC) estimation in lithium-ion batteries. Previously, we explored LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for SOC prediction tasks, given their effectiveness in handling sequential data. However, while LSTM performed well in many cases, we observed fluctuations in SOC predictions, particularly during rapid changes in SOC. These fluctuations motivated us to explore alternative architectures better suited for capturing temporal dependencies without introducing the level of complexity associated with LSTM models.

### Why Temporal CNN?
Temporal CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks for time-series data) offer an efficient alternative to recurrent models like LSTM. Temporal CNNs can capture local temporal patterns in the data, and they are often faster and less prone to overfitting when dealing with large sequences. Unlike ConvLSTM, which combines convolution and recurrence, Temporal CNN focuses purely on convolutional layers to extract temporal features, making it both simpler and potentially more robust for our task. Through this approach, the Temporal CNN achieved precise SOC predictions with minimal fluctuations and a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **1.41%**, marking an improvement over prior methods.

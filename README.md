This repository contains an implementation of a Temporal CNN model for State of Charge (SOC) estimation in lithium-ion batteries. Previously, we explored LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models for SOC prediction tasks, given their effectiveness in handling sequential data. However, while LSTM performed well in many cases, we encountered frustrating fluctuations in SOC predictions, especially during rapid changes in SOC. These fluctuations motivated us to seek alternative architectures that could capture temporal dependencies more reliably, leading us to implement a Temporal CNN model with the goal of achieving smoother, more consistent SOC predictions without the added complexity of LSTM models.

### ‚åõ Why Temporal CNN?
Temporal CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks for time-series data) offer an efficient alternative to recurrent models like LSTM. Temporal CNNs can capture local temporal patterns in the data, and they are often faster and less prone to overfitting when dealing with large sequences. Unlike ConvLSTM, which combines convolution and recurrence, Temporal CNN focuses purely on convolutional layers to extract temporal features, making it both simpler and potentially more robust for our task. Through this approach, the Temporal CNN achieved precise SOC predictions with minimal fluctuations and a **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** of **1.41%**, marking an improvement over prior methods.

### üîç SOC Prediction Error Analysis

The following section provides an analysis of the SOC prediction errors for different ambient temperatures (-10¬∞C, 0¬∞C, 10¬∞C, and 25¬∞C), as visualized in the error plots.

#### üìä Key Insights:
1. **Overall Error Distribution**:
   - Across all temperatures, the model maintains a low prediction error for most of the SOC range, highlighting its robustness and accuracy in tracking SOC trends.
   - Prediction errors generally stay within a 0.05 (5%) range, with occasional spikes. This consistent performance demonstrates the model's reliability under various temperature conditions.

2. **üå°Ô∏è Temperature-Specific Observations**:
   - **0¬∞C**:
     - Error remains consistently low across most of the samples, with periodic spikes around significant SOC transitions.
     - This suggests that the model performs well at 0¬∞C, with minor deviations during rapid SOC changes.
     - ![Prediction Error at 0¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_0C_plot.png)

   - **10¬∞C**:
     - The error pattern is similar to that at 0¬∞C, with slightly increased variability.
     - Some notable error spikes appear around the middle of the SOC range, potentially due to transitional states where SOC estimation becomes more challenging.
     - ![Prediction Error at 10¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_10C_plot.png)

   - **-10¬∞C**:
     - At lower temperatures, the model encounters more variability in error, with more frequent and noticeable spikes.
     - The largest errors appear during significant SOC drops, indicating that colder temperatures may affect the model‚Äôs response to rapid SOC changes.
     - ![Prediction Error at -10¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_-10C_plot.png)

     - The model shows stable performance with low error levels at 25¬∞C, similar to 0¬∞C.
     - Error spikes are fewer and less pronounced, suggesting that the model performs best under moderate temperatures, likely due to reduced variability in battery dynamics at this range.
     - ![Prediction Error at 25¬∞C](results/prediction_error_at_25C_plot.png)

3. **‚ö° Error Spikes During SOC Transitions**:
   - Common to all temperatures, error spikes are most frequent during periods of sharp SOC transitions, such as rapid charging or discharging phases.
   - This indicates that while the model is highly accurate in steady-state conditions, high dynamic SOC changes pose more challenges, especially under extreme temperatures like -10¬∞C.

#### üìà Summary:
These error analyses provide valuable insights into the model's behavior across different temperature conditions. The results suggest that while the model achieves high accuracy, future improvements could focus on minimizing prediction variability during rapid SOC transitions, particularly at extreme temperatures like -10¬∞C.

### üîç Insights from Residual Analysis Across Temperatures

- **Systematic Error Patterns Across SOC Ranges**:
  - At lower SOC values (below 0.5), residuals show more variation, especially at extreme temperatures (-10¬∞C and 25¬∞C).
  - Residuals tend to cluster more tightly around zero in the mid-range SOC values (0.5‚Äì0.8), indicating better model performance in this range.

- **Higher Residuals at Temperature Extremes**:
  - At -10¬∞C and 25¬∞C, residuals are more spread out and intense, especially at low SOC values, suggesting less accuracy in extreme conditions.
  - The model shows tendencies to overestimate or underestimate SOC in specific ranges, possibly due to the temperature‚Äôs impact on battery characteristics.

- **Consistent Performance at Moderate Temperatures**:
  - For 0¬∞C and 10¬∞C, residuals are generally lower and distributed more evenly, indicating improved accuracy at these temperatures.
  - This trend suggests the model handles moderate temperatures better, likely due to training data conditions closer to these ranges.

- **Residual Clustering Around Zero**:
  - Across all temperatures, many residuals are centered around zero, showing accurate predictions in these regions.
  - However, clusters of larger positive or negative residuals highlight areas where model refinement is needed.

### Key Insights:
- **SOC Dependency**: The model's accuracy varies across SOC levels, with larger residuals at low and high SOC values, particularly at extreme temperatures.
- **Temperature Sensitivity**: The model may benefit from tuning or additional temperature-aware features to improve accuracy under extreme conditions.
- **Opportunities for Model Improvement**: Exploring temperature-aware features or additional data augmentation could enhance model performance across diverse conditions, particularly for extreme temperatures.

This analysis provides valuable insights into areas for model refinement, especially under conditions where battery behavior is more variable.

- Dynamic Range Quantization for basic optimization:
```bash
python convert_model.py --model_path temporal_cnn_model.h5 --output_path temporal_cnn_model_
```
### 2. Model Integration
Once the model is converted, embed it within the firmware code:
1. Convert temporal_cnn_model.tflite to a C array using a tool like xxd or Bin2Header.
2. Integrate the array directly into real_time_inference_firmware.cpp.

Follow these steps to build and upload the firmware to your target device.
